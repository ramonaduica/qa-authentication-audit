QA Test Cases: Simple PHP User Authentication App

Goal: Verify core functionality (Registration, Login) and identify common security and UX flaws in the application logic.
| Test Case ID | Feature | Description | Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| TC-REG-001 | Registration | Successful new user registration. | 1. Enter a unique username/email (e.g., test@example.com). 2. Enter a strong password (e.g., P@ssword123!). 3. Click "Register Account". | Success message displayed. User record is created in the SQLite database. | Success message displayed: "Registration successful! You can now log in." User created. | PASS |
| TC-REG-002 | Registration | Unique username constraint validation. | 1. Attempt to register using the same username from TC-REG-001. 2. Enter any password. 3. Click "Register Account". | Error message displayed indicating the username is already taken. | Error message displayed: "Username already exists. Please choose another." | PASS |
| TC-REG-003 | Registration | Empty field validation. | 1. Leave the password field empty. 2. Click "Register Account". | Error message displayed: "Please fill in all fields." | Error message displayed: "Please fill in all fields." | PASS |
| TC-REG-004 | SECURITY FLAW: Weak Password Policy | Verify server-side password strength enforcement. | 1. Enter a unique username/email. 2. Enter an extremely short password (e.g., 123). 3. Click "Register Account". | Expected: Error message displayed: "Password must be at least 8 characters..." | Actual: Success message displayed. The user is registered with the weak password. | FAIL (CRITICAL BUG) |
| TC-LOG-001 | Login | Successful login with valid credentials. | 1. Enter the username and correct password from TC-REG-001. 2. Click "Log In". | Success message displayed, and the "Currently logged in as" status bar appears. | Success message displayed, and logged-in status bar appears. | PASS |
| TC-LOG-002 | Login | Login with empty fields. | 1. Click "Log In" without entering credentials. | Error message displayed: "Please fill in all fields." | Error message displayed: "Please fill in all fields." | PASS |
| TC-LOG-003 | SECURITY/UX FLAW: Generic Error Message | Test login with a valid username but an incorrect password. | 1. Enter a valid username (e.g., from TC-REG-001). 2. Enter an incorrect password (e.g., wrong). 3. Click "Log In". | Expected: Clear error message that only references the password, or, ideally, security controls (like rate limiting) to slow down attempts. | Actual: Generic error message displayed: "Invalid credentials provided. Please try again." (This message is identical whether the username is valid or non-existent, and there is no rate limiting.) | FAIL (VULNERABILITY) |
